          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hello! I am Sereen, a Year 3 student studying the Diploma in Media and Communication in Singapore Polytechnic.I am currently seeking an internship opportunity.
            I enjoy reading, travelling and nature. I always would like my actions or work to inspire people as I want to make a difference in my daily work. I also enjoy making people happy because it makes me happy. I believe it is important to remain grounded, respectful and compassionate no matter what comes your way.Also, as you can tell, I am obsessed with chicken wings.</p>

          <h1>Yellow Ribbon Project</h1>
          <p>We were tasked to pitch an Integrated Marketing Campaign which would lead up to an event.
            The objective of the campaign was to break the youth's perception of ex offenders and help integrate them back into our society.
            3 different groups pitched an idea and my group's campaign idea was picked. As such, we were the campaign lead team for this project. We sourced for our secondary school participants during Singapore Polytechnic's Open House and encouraged them to come down for our event. My role was the Events and Budget IC. </p>

          <h1>Amana</h1>
            <p>For our Visual Communication's module, we were tasked to create a corporate identity.
              I chose to create an identity for a counselling centre, Amana which means peace in Punjabi. The idea behind the identity was how everyone is an unsolved puzzle and when he or she has completed counselling, he or she becomes a solved puzzle. I depicted this by using geometric shapes. I also used negative images to portray letters M and N in Amana. </p>
